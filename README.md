# üê∂ NYC Dog Licensing Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project uses real dog licensing data from New York City to explore trends in pet ownership across ZIP codes, time, breed, and dog age. The goal is to identify patterns that can help city agencies or pet-focused organizations plan more effective and better-targeted town halls for dog owners.  
The project includes data cleaning and feature engineering in Python, followed by interactive visualizations built in Tableau.
